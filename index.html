        <p>About me</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Hello.. I am Kibet Kyle, a 22 year old web-development student at Moringa School. I live in Nairobi and I currently have skills in HTML and CSS but looking forward to becoming a full-stack web-developer before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>I love cars and poems soo much, and my hobbies would be watching, listening to music and reading poems especially Hafizâ€™s.I also enjoy driving especially manual turboed cars.</p>
        <p>There is nothing I would find more fulfilling than providing solutions to problems people face through tech thus the reason I took the web-dev course.</p>
